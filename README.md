## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![Linear Regression to Predict MPG](./Resources/del1.png)

As per the summary results above, we can confidently state the following:

- Intercept, vehicle length, and ground clearance provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset
- The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because we have a very low p-value (much lower the 5%) and a high r-squared value: `0.71`
- This linear model does predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively. The reason is that our Intercept is not statistically significant which could mean that our independent variables explain a significant amount of variability of our dependant variable
