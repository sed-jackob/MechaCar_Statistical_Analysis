## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![Linear Regression to Predict MPG](./Resources/del1.png)

As per the summary results above, we can confidently state the following:

- Intercept, vehicle length, and ground clearance provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset
- The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because we have a very low p-value (much lower the 5%) and a high r-squared value: `0.71`
- This linear model does predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively. The reason is that our Intercept is not statistically significant which could mean that our independent variables explain a significant amount of variability of our dependant variable

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

Based on the above summary tables, we can state the following:

- The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

Based on the above t-tests results, we can interpret the following:
- 
- 
- 

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

Write a short description of a statistical study that can quantify how the MechaCar performs against the competition. In your study design, think critically about what metrics would be of interest to a consumer: for a few examples, cost, city or highway fuel efficiency, horse power, maintenance cost, or safety rating.

In your description, address the following questions:

- What metric or metrics are you going to test?
- What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
- What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
- What data is needed to run the statistical test?
